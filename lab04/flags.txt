avx: avx, avx2, avx_vnni
avx is a set of SIMD instructions that can do math on 8 32-bit floats or 4
64-bit doubles simultaneously. avx2 expands this to include integers.
avx_vnni (avx vector neural network instructions) adds extra
instructions for 512-bit vectors.

sse: sse, sse2, sse4_1, sse4_1, ssse3
