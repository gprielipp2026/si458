The same thing is happening as in matrixrow.c, except that the order of things had to be switched up slightly.
Since the matrices are in col form now,
the "vcol" is coming from A. And must be brought in using _mm_load_ps, instead of _mm_broadcast_ss.
Similarily, since "vrow" is now coming from B, it must be brought in using _mm_broadcast_ss, instead of _mm_load_ps.

That is the only change that was required (besides a little for loop restructuring).
