1. parse input (all ints):
  1. max number of iterations
  2. threshold (value inside [-threshold, threshold] eligible for updating)
  3. display frequency
  4. seed for rand
    1. seed < 0 ==> use time(null)
  5. number of threads (>=0)
    1. =0 ==> only the main thread
    2. ie: it's specifying extra threads to create
  6. verbosity for debugging
    1. =2 ==> time it
      1. use timer.h & struct clock_t
      - format: Time: # sec #.# millisec
    2. >0 ==> each thread prints:
      1. logical thread ID
      2. start & end column index value
      3. total number of columns it's allocated
      - format: tid #   columns:   #:#   (#)
2. initialize the grid:
  1. ask user for rows (num rows: ):
    1. rows = 0 ==> use file (filename: )
      1. file in format:
      <rows> <cols> <num entries>
      <row> <col> <val>
      ...
    2. rows > 0 ==> ask for cols (num cols: )
  2. if not from file:
    1. set matrix to all zeros
3. create pthread_barrier for synchronization
4. create all threads, store in array on stack
5. run all threads
  1. loop over all iterations
  2. if need to display matrix:
    1. print thread displays matrix, pauses all other threads until it's done
    - print thread will be the main thread
  3. update a cell as needed:
    1. loop over every cell assigned to this thread
    2. if cell within  [-threshold, threshold]:
      1. cell += rand_num(range)
    3. if no updates occurred, terminate thread
  4. wait for all threads to finish one clock cycle before continuing loop
6. wait for all threads to terminate
7. free all allocated memory
