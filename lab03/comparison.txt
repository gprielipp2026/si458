Times (can only run in valgrind so they're quite inflated):
  -  256:  0.299s
  -  512:  2.375s
  - 1024: 19.431s

Bytes (of each matrix):
  -  256:    65,536
  -  512:   262,144
  - 1024: 1,048,576

Ratios:
  Times:
    - 256 ->  512: 7.943
    - 512 -> 1024: 8.181
  Bytes:
    - 256 ->  512: 4
    - 512 -> 1024: 4

There is such a large jump in times because the number of bytes of each matrix grows quadratically.
