# Lab02 - George Prielipp (265112)

## Outline

1. Parse the arguments into a struct
  1. Required in argv: <# gens to simulate> <freq of grid display>
  2. Optional: <seed for rand> <rows (N)> <cols (M)>
    1. If not in argv, get file from stdin
2. Create the matrix (N+2)x(M+2)
3. Initialize matrix
  1. from txt file: 
    1. N M InputSize
    2. X Y
  2. all args used:
    1. every entry = rand() % 2
4. Run the simulation:
  1. update the halo
  2. update the grid:
    1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
    2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
    3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
